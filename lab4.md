**Description:** In this lab, we were tasked with utilizing Django, which is a framework that supports the development of web aplications. Additionally, we utilized Flask, another python-based web framework.
**Pre-Lab Steps:** In order to execute some steps in this lab, I had to create a virtual environment. In order to do this, I executed the following code:
```python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```
Additionaly, I had to install some additional packages, including `django`, `djangorestframework`, `setuptools`, `django-filter`, `markdown`, `requests`, and `flask`
