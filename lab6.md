**Description:** For this lab, we had to use Node.js and Pystache. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment, typically used for web development. Pystache is a python-implementation of mustache, which is a web template system typically used for creating HTML files.

**Lab Setup:** To prepare for this lab, I had to install Node.js and Pystache. To install Node.js, I downloaded the Windows installer. On the other hand, to install Pystache, I used the terminal command: 'pip install pystache'

hello.js

The webpage for this program is the same. However, every time the page is refreshed, two messages are output to the terminal. The two messages are : "response end call done" and "request end event fired".

http.js

This program counts the amount of times the generated webpage is refreshed. The count is shown both in the terminal output and on the webpage itself.
