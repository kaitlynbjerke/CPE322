**Description:** for this lab, we were tasked to practice **Bash** commands using the **Git Bash** terminal. We learned what the different commands do and how to use them

**Resources Used:** I used a variety of resources to aid my in the project, including [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions)

hostname
--
A **hostname** is a name given to a computer to identify it over a network. Using this command tells us what our hostname is.

env

The env command prints out all the **environment variables**, which decribe the environment in which a program runs. Environment variables have a name and a value, which decribes the path to the program.

ps
--
The ps command shows a list of currently running **processes**, or tasks currently running on them system.
![ps](https://github.com/kaitlynbjerke/Images/blob/main/ps.png)

pwd
--
pwd stands for "print working directory." A working directory is the directory folder in which we are working.
![pwd](https://github.com/kaitlynbjerke/Images/blob/main/pwd.png)

git clone
--
This command creates a copy of a remote repository.
![git](https://github.com/kaitlynbjerke/Images/blob/main/git_clone.png)

cd iot

![ls](https://github.com/kaitlynbjerke/Images/blob/main/ls.png)

cd
--
This command brings you back to the previous directory.
![cd](https://github.com/kaitlynbjerke/Images/blob/main/cd.png)

df

This shows the current disk space available on the file system.
![df](https://github.com/kaitlynbjerke/Images/blob/main/df.png)

mkdir demo
--
This command makes a directory called demo
![mkdir](https://github.com/kaitlynbjerke/Images/blob/main/mkdir.png)

cd demo
--
This changes the directory to demo
![cddemo](https://github.com/kaitlynbjerke/Images/blob/main/cd_demo.png)

nano file

The cat command has multiple uses, including to read, concatenate, and writes files. In this case, it is reading the contents of the "file" text file.
![cat](https://github.com/kaitlynbjerke/Images/blob/main/cat_file.png)

![copy](https://github.com/kaitlynbjerke/Images/blob/main/copy_file.png)

mv file file 2
--
This moves the contents of file into file2. Unlike the cp command, the mv command does not keep the original file.
![mv](https://github.com/kaitlynbjerke/Images/blob/main/mv_file.png)

man uname
--
The man command opens a "manual" of the specified command in linux. **Note:** The "man" command was not working on my machine, and upon further research, I discovered a different command that had similar functionality. Man gives a more complete desciption on the command, while "--help" shows the usage of the command.
![man](https://github.com/kaitlynbjerke/Images/blob/main/uname_help.png)

uname -a

This command prints all available system information.
![uname](https://github.com/kaitlynbjerke/Images/blob/main/uname.png)

ifconfig
--
The ifconfig command shows all network interface parameters. **Note:** on my operating system, ifconfig did not work and I instead used a command called "ipconfig". ipconfig shows informaton about all network interfaces, while ifconfig only shows information about enabled network interfaces.
![ifconfig](https://github.com/kaitlynbjerke/Images/blob/main/ipconfig.png)

ping localhost

This command send **packets**, or small segments of a message, to the localhost, which then sends an echo signal back. This command is meant to test connectivity over a network.

netstat stands for "network statistic", and shows all TCP connections. **TCP**, or Transmission Control Protocol, is a communications protocol that allows for the exchange of messages over a network.
