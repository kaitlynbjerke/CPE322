**Description:** For this lab, we want to investigate how python can be used for data analysis. Specifically, we used our previously generated data from lab 7, and used python functions to generate graphs / plots.

**Prelab tasks:** Before starting this lab, we had to install some libraries. I used pip to install these libraries, and I executed this line of code: `pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib pandas tensorflow keras`
